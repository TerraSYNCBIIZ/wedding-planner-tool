# Advanced Management Features Implementation

We've implemented the following advanced management features:

1. **Workspace Management**
   - Delete workspaces
   - Remove users from workspaces
   - Change user access levels (editor/viewer)

2. **Account Management**
   - Delete user account

## How to Test

1. Start the development server with 'npm run dev'
2. Navigate to the Profile page
3. In the 'Manage Your Workspaces' section, select a workspace
4. Use the Workspace Management panel to:
   - View all workspace members
   - Change member roles between Editor and Viewer
   - Remove members from the workspace
   - Delete the entire workspace (if you're the owner)
5. Test the 'Delete Account' feature in the Account Details section

Note: All destructive actions have confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletions.
