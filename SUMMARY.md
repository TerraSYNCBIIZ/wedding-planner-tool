## Migration Strategy

To ensure a smooth transition for existing users:

1. **Pre-Migration Communication**:
   - Inform users about the upcoming changes
   - Explain the benefits of the new system

2. **Migration Process**:
   - Deploy the migration system
   - Monitor migration progress
   - Provide support for users experiencing issues

3. **Post-Migration**:
   - Verify data integrity
   - Collect feedback from users
   - Make adjustments based on user feedback

## Conclusion

The Wedding Planner Tool now has a solid foundation with a service-based architecture that ensures data consistency, proper error handling, and real-time updates. The workspace management system has been completely redesigned to fix the issues with data deletion, role management, and collaboration features.

The next phase of development should focus on enhancing the user experience and implementing the remaining features while maintaining the high standards of code quality and architecture established in this phase.
